# RHForm
To learning React-hook-form

In that repository i'll try to learn more about React-hook-form, the same way i'm doing with other repo, all ways trying to get better and tracking some great oportunity to work.

You will find here good things that you can do with RHF (it getting better when you are begginer, of course), test (_in Jest library_), and validattion.

All those things are just for my curiosity and pratice, 'cause my goal is just to learn more about developing and program things thats can be used for all, and and i believe that one day i'll rocking with it.
